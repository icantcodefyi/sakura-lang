## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Research on language design, agent ergonomics, memory management, effects,
  standard-library direction, and open-source engineering practices in `research/`.
- Bun / Next.js / Fumadocs website and documentation delivery in `website/`.
- Initial language design in `docs/design.md`, with proposed syntax and open decisions.
- Community governance, contribution and AI-assistance policies, security guidance,
  and dual MIT OR Apache-2.0 licensing.
- RFC and architecture decision records, compatibility policy, GitHub contribution
  forms, and bootstrap CI/dependency automation.
- `sakura mcp serve`: the compiler as an MCP server with check, symbol and hole queries,
  docs, formatting, checked patches and test runs. Setup: [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).
- `sakura lsp`: a language server with diagnostics, hover, go to definition, completion,
  formatting and quick fixes.
- `sakura fix [--preview] [--apply ids]` applies compiler fixes by impact class, and
  `sakura check --frozen-specs <symbols|all> [--since rev]` reports spec changes since a git
  revision as `V8020`.
- `sakura new <cli|lib|agent|api> <name>` and `sakura init` scaffold a project, and `sakura run` exits
  75 when `main` declares an effect that `[permissions]` does not grant.

- `Tool.of` lowers a named `@tool` function through `Tool.from` with synthesized argument schema.
- Effect-row parameters on types, including `Tool<e>`, `Agent<T, e>` and `Router<e>`.
- Opaque constructor/field access outside the defining module is rejected with `V1006`;
  compiler-known prelude `Trust` restricts `@trust("reason")` to trusted sink arguments (`V6001`).
- `sql"…"` interpolations convert through `SqlValue.from` and remain bound parameters.
- Typed failures escaping test bodies are reported as test failures.
- All twelve examples pass their configured harness modes (six run plus test, four test,
  two check-only); full execution/replay remains an M3 exit gate.

### Changed

- Renamed the language from Vow to Sakura Lang: binary `sakura`, sources `.sakura`, manifest `sakura.toml`, crates `sakura_*`, env `SAKURA_*`, URIs `sakura://`, repo `icantcodefyi/sakura-lang`. Diagnostic codes are unchanged. <!-- rename:keep -->

- Host handlers enforce manifest grants delivered by `sakura run` in `SAKURA_PERMISSIONS`.
- Analysis rechecks only edited modules when public interfaces are unchanged; interface
  changes invalidate dependents. Lowering still processes the whole program.
- Roadmap and source-build documentation now distinguish implemented M3 behavior from
  M3 exit gates, planned M4 WASM/verification and M5 native execution.

### Fixed

- `Llm.stream` under `Llm.anthropic` requests server-sent events and calls `on_partial` once per
  text delta instead of once with the whole reply.
- `sakura fmt` no longer drops comments in import lists, after `where`, or before a binary `-`,
  keeps one-line block comments inline in lists and statements, and lays out comments after
  `=` and `=>` instead of copying the statement verbatim. If formatting would still lose a
  comment or produce code that does not parse, the file is left unchanged and `V9001` reported.
